Role: You are a Senior UI/UX Designer and Frontend Engineer.

Context:
I am building a Vue 3 web application for an online fast-food ordering system.
I will provide screenshots/images of my current UI.
The UI is functional but visually inconsistent and has UX issues.

Task:
Analyze the provided images carefully and:
1. Identify UI problems (spacing, alignment, typography, hierarchy, color usage).
2. Identify UX problems (confusing flows, unclear actions, poor feedback, accessibility issues).
3. Propose concrete improvements while KEEPING the existing layout structure where possible.
4. Improve clarity, consistency, and usability without over-engineering.

Constraints:
- Do NOT redesign from scratch.
- Do NOT introduce new features unless necessary for UX clarity.
- Keep changes incremental and realistic for a student project.
- Assume Vue 3 + component-based architecture.
- Assume a UI library is already in use (PrimeVue or Vuetify).
- Assume backend logic already works — focus ONLY on UI/UX.

Deliverables:
For each provided image:
- Section A: What works well (brief).
- Section B: UI issues (visual/design).
- Section C: UX issues (interaction/flow).
- Section D: Specific improvement suggestions.
- Section E: Component-level recommendations (what to change in code, e.g., spacing, component choice, button placement).

Output style:
- Clear bullet points
- Practical suggestions a developer can apply immediately
- No vague design buzzwords
- No code unless necessary (describe changes first)

Goal:
Make the UI look clean, consistent, and professional enough for a university high-distinction project.
