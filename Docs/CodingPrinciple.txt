You are a Senior Frontend Engineer. Build a Vue 3 (Vite) SPA for an online fast-food ordering system.

Tech constraints:
- Vue 3 + TypeScript
- Vue Router
- Pinia for state management
- Axios for API calls
- UI library: PrimeVue (preferred) OR Vuetify (choose one and stay consistent)
- Form validation: VeeValidate + Yup (or built-in rules if using Vuetify)
- Styling: clean, modern, professional, responsive (mobile + desktop)

Backend:
- ASP.NET Core API, Swagger available
- JWT auth
- Roles: Guest, Customer, Admin
- Base API URL: http://localhost:5000/api/v1

App requirements:
Guest:
- Browse foods and combos
- Product/combo detail page
- Search basic and advanced (name, price range, category/topic/tag)
Customer:
- Register and login
- Manage profile
- Cart and checkout
- Order history and order tracking (status timeline)
Admin:
- Admin login
- Admin dashboard
- CRUD: Users, Products, Combos, Orders
- Cannot delete current admin (show UI message if attempted)
Security/UX:
- Store JWT in memory or localStorage (your call), include refresh-safe pattern
- Axios interceptor adds Authorization header
- Router guards for auth + role-based access
- Show toast notifications on success/error
- Friendly empty states and error states

Deliverables:
- Full file structure with code for each file
- Reusable components (NavBar, Footer, ProductCard, ComboCard, CartDrawer, ConfirmDialog)
- API service layer with typed DTOs
- Pinia stores: authStore, catalogStore, cartStore, adminStore
- Pages:
  / (home), /menu, /product/:id, /combo/:id, /search
  /login, /register, /profile, /cart, /checkout, /orders, /orders/:id
  /admin/login, /admin, /admin/users, /admin/products, /admin/combos, /admin/orders

Implementation details:
- Use composables for common logic (useAuth, useApi, useToast)
- Use environment variable VITE_API_BASE_URL
- Include a simple role badge and user menu dropdown
- Create a layout system: PublicLayout, CustomerLayout, AdminLayout

Output format:
1) Show folder tree
2) Then provide complete code blocks for every file
3) No placeholders like “TODO” unless absolutely necessary
4) Ensure the app runs after npm install + npm run dev

Important: do NOT invent endpoints. If an endpoint is unknown, create a typed api method and mark the URL as a configurable constant in apiRoutes.ts. Keep UI functional with mock fallback data only if the API method is not implemented, and clearly separate mock logic.
